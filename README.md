Abstract of the paper:

> This work provided a long-term electrophysiological dataset of 10 pilocarpine-treated temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) rats during the development of epilepsy. The dataset was constituted by multi-site local field potential (LFP) signal recorded from 12 sites in the circuit of Papez in TLE, including spontaneous seizures and interictal fragments in the chronic period. The LFP data were saved in MATLAB, stored as the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) standard, and published on the DANDI Archive. The dataset can be used to evaluate the alterations of seizure onset zone (SOZ), seizure onset pattern (SOP), and functional network connectivity during the development of epilepsy. We have technically validated the dataset through histology and specific signal analysis. In addition, we provided MATLAB codes for basic analyses of this dataset, including power spectral analysis, SOP identification, and interictal spike detection. The dataset is available to reveal how electrophysiological and epileptic network properties of chronic TLE rats change from early to late stages, and help inform the design of adaptive neuromodulation for epilepsy.
